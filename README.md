#NB JSON

The JSONInterpreter class uses a library, you can find it there:
https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/downloads/list (take the 1.1.1 version)

Then add the .jar to your project.

Reminder of idiotic conventions : variables, functions, and almost anything is cased likeThat (lower case and then upper case)

I think you can still write classes name LikeThat tho'.
